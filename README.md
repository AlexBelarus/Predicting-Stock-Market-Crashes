# Predicting Crashes in Financial Markets

A financial crash occurs when prices drop sharply and rapidly – typically more than 10% within a few days. Such a crash can be the side effect of a catastrophic event but marks more often the collapse of a long-term speculative bubble. Famous examples of major stock market crashes happened in 1987 (“Black Monday”) and 2008 (real estate bubble).

Predicting crashes to avoid substantial financial losses is a problem that a large variety of market participants are trying to solve. While economists and analysts mostly analyze economic indicators, some mathematicians and physicians investigated price patterns to identify and predict such events. A popular example is Physics professor Didier Sornette who applied power laws (found to predict earthquakes) to financial markets and successfully predicted multiple financial crashes (one example being the 2008 mortgage bubble).

With this project I aim to to predict financial crashes using historical price information with machine learning algorithms. While Professor Sornette applies power laws to price information to predict crashes, a machine learning algorithm is instead expected to learn price patterns that precede a financial crash and to predict future crashes that way. 

This project is work in progress and and I am updating code that presents the findings in Jupyter notebooks on an ongoing basis.
